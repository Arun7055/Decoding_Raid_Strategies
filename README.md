## Overview

Kabaddi is a fast-paced sport where match outcomes are heavily influenced by raid performance.  
This research analyzes how specific raid types impact team success using machine learning models.

The study focuses on:

- Super Raids  
- Do-or-Die Raids  
- Super 10s  
- Super Tackles  
- Final match and season outcomes  

The goal is to understand which parameters most strongly influence winning probability and rankings.

## Methodology

We analyzed match and season-level data and trained multiple machine learning models:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost  

Models were compared based on prediction accuracy and correlation strength.

## Key Findings

Our analysis of Pro Kabaddi League data revealed the **relative impact of different raid situations on match outcomes**.

**Order of impact (highest to lowest):**
1. Super Raids
2. Do-or-Die Raids
3. Super 10 performances
4. Super Tackles
- Offensive parameters influence match outcomes more than defensive parameters like Super Tackles.
- Data-driven insights can help coaches:
  - Optimize lineups  
  - Adjust strategies mid-match  
  - Improve tactical planning
